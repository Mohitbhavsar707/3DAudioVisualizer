# 3DAudioVisualizer
Created an audio visualizer using processing by using object orientated programming, and FFT and Amplitude formulas. 



How to use the code?

Preferred Method: Method 1:

Create a new sketch file on processing and paste the content from the multiple files into the sketch file one by one.
Next download the audio file or select a song of your own and update the code in the main file that imports the sound file - to access the file location right click on the audio file, then go to properties and copy paste the location (starts with C://....)


Method 2: Clone the repository and upload the code onto processing, and then update the image/sound import codes
